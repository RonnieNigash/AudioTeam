				<h3>About MWT</h3>

				Melanesian Women Today is the VOICE of the Melanesian Women, Mothers, and Girls throughout the South Pacific Countries and the Globe.
<br /> <br />
It focuses on contemporary issues that are affecting the well-being and lifestyle of women and families in the Melanesian islands today. It addresses the effects of the global economic crisis on the livelihood of women and their children particularly on serious gender specific consequences.
<br /> <br />
While women (and men) in most Melanesian countries are vulnerable to increased risk of poverty and hardship, gender susceptibility to negative impacts are especially at high risk. Topics such as the impact of the pre-existing high infant mortality rates, gender disparity on education and womenâ€™s economic empowerment will also be addressed and more.
<br /> <br />
The main purpose of this blog is to give women in the Melanesian countries a Voice through entrepreneurial empowerment by focusing on the following:
<br /> <br />
Mentoring<br />
Networking<br />
Coaching<br />
Access to Financial resources and research<br /><br />
